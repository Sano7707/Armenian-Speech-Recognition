# Armenian Speech Recognition Project

This project aims to develop a Speech-to-Text Recognition (STR) system for the Armenian language, addressing the need for advanced language processing technologies in this context. Leveraging state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models, the system enables users to transcribe Armenian audio files with high accuracy and efficiency.

## Frontend

The frontend of the project is implemented using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with various features, including:

- Recording and uploading audio files
- Selecting from different speech recognition models
- Viewing transcription results
- User authentication and registration


## Backend

The project's backend is developed using Java Spring Boot, a framework for building web applications. It handles critical operations such as user authentication, audio processing, and data management. Key components include:

- User authentication and registration
- Audio processing using pre-trained models
- Data storage and management with MongoDB


## Cloud Deployment

The project is deployed on the Azure Cloud platform, leveraging virtual machine resources with 4v CPUs and 16GB of RAM. This infrastructure provides robust computational resources to support the efficient processing of audio data and the seamless operation of the system.
